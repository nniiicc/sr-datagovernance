* Abstract - "We conduct a systematic survey with the aim of assessing open government data initiatives, that is; any attempt, by a government or otherwise, to open data that is produced by a governmental entity. We describe the open government data life-cycle and we focus our discussion on publishing and consuming processes required within open government data initiatives. We cover current approaches undertaken for such initiatives, and classify them. A number of evaluations found within related literature are discussed, and from them we extract challenges and issues that hinder open government initiatives from reaching their full potential. In a bid to overcome these challenges, we also extract guidelines for publishing data and provide an integrated overview. This will enable stakeholders to start with a firm foot in a new open government data initiative. We also identify the impacts on the stakeholders involved in such initiatives."

Summary

* Focus - review of literature regarding open government data initiatives (i.e. publication process & portal/platform - how data is offered to the public)

* "Systematic survey of “literature related to publishing and consuming open data through government portals, data catalogues, or otherwise”, with aim of providing “an integrated and unified model that covers the relevant concepts, terminology, initiatives, challenges, and guidelines”

* Research Question/Subquestions - “What are existing approaches that enable the publishing & consumption of government data?”
    * What are existing approaches for publishing or consuming open government data, and how can they be classified?
    * What are the supported technical aspects, features and functions in existing approaches?
    * Are there any defined guidelines for the publishing or consumption of open government data?
    * What are existing challenges with publishing or consuming open government data?

* Methodology
    * Formal systematic review with explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria, limited to English language publications from 2002-October 2014
    * Databases searched: ACM, IEEE, Science Direct, Springer Link, ISI Web of Knowledge
    * Conducted pilot searches to settle on terms – list of 14 terms (p. 401) (variations on government, public, portal, data, publishing, consumption, publication, etc.) searched as an ‘OR’ string; searched on both title & abstract
    * Inclusion criteria – focus on OG portals/data/publishing/consumption; describes OG initiatives
    * Exclusion criteria – does not focus on OG portals/data/publishing/consumption; focus on OD in general rather than government OD
    * 338 publications -> 159 (title review) -> 103 (abstract review) -> 75 (full text review)

* Terminology
    * Open Data – “data that is available free of charge for the general public without any limitations” (vs. Public Data – “made freely available to the public, [but] not necessarily open”) (vs. Linked Data – follows best practices for connecting structured data on web)
    * Open Government Data – “subset of Open Data, and is simply government-related data that is made open to the public”
    * E-government – “government’s use of technology to enhance the services it offers to other entities, including citizens, buisness partners, employees, and other government agences.” – idea that ‘open government” is a subset or extension of E-government
    * Data Portal – single entry point to hosted data that coordinates search of and access to data, and management of dataset metadata (vs. Data Catalogue – registry of data sources)
    * Data consumption – includes both “exploration, where a user visualises or scrutinises open data” and “exploitation, where a user adds value to the open data…”
    * Data Quality – no single definition, but often thought of as “fitness for use”, which involves both subjective & objective measures

* OGD Lifecycle - include discussion of OGD lifecycle, but indicate that focus here is limited to publishing and consuming parts of cycle

* OGD Initiatives
    * Review proposed assessment frameworks (Table 1) and existing evaluations of data portals/initiatives (Table 2) – assessments often rely on LOD or 8 OGD principles, and/or evaluate features/functionality of data portals
    * Identify most common ‘challenges’ facing OGD initiatives observed in literature:
        * Data format – formatting often not subject to legal or regulatory requirements, which can result in significant ‘silo-ing’ of data within same OGD initiative
        * Data ambiguity – semantic ambiguity as to what data represent; need for more descriptive metadata/variable names
        * Data discoverability – relies on metadata quality and portal functionality, as well as centralization (or lack thereof) of data sources
        * Data representation – heterogenity in sematics, standards, schemas makes in difficult to aggregate metadata across datasets (i.e. different types of data/data from different sub-units often use descriptive metadata fields differently)
        * Overlapping Scope – local/regional/national levels issue – datasets may be duplicated at multiple levels, or become integrated into each other without clear provenance
        * Public Participation – consensus that participation in OGD (i.e. rating of datasets, suggesting datasets for publication, etc.) not at ideal levels

* Publishing/Consuming OGD
    * Suggest that approaches to research on publishing can be broadly categorized as either  a) Technological – focusing on the act of publishing data to the web i.e. format, access method, linkage) or b) Organizational – focusing on provision of data to consumers, i.e. directly via portal vs. indirectly via catalogue
    * Review literature regarding guidelines/rules for OGD publication:
        * Majority based on 8 OGD principles & LOD principles
        * Also note W3C eGov steps for OGD publication (p. 409) – Identify, Document, Link, Preserve (versioning), Expose Interfaces, Create Standard Names/URIs 
        * Discuss ‘maturity models’ for OGD proposed in literature
    * Publishing Tools – review literature on publishing platforms; standardized metadata vocuabulary to aid in publication of OGD
    * Consuming Data – review how OGD portals allow data to be consumed (i.e. presence of exploration features such as visualization, comparison, etc. vs. download only)
    * Data Quality – enumerate factors seen as influencing data quality in relevant literature: Usability, Accuracy, Completeness, Consistency, Timeliness, Accessability, Openness
        * Note that some of these factors are relatively generic and depend on/include each other – i.e. usability could involve any of the other factors; openness and accessability can be seen as interdependent
    * Challenges - review key challenges to OGD publication from literature
        * To entities investing in openness – awareness, motivation (i.e. failure to see value in opening), capacity, budget, technical support, lack of established institutional responsbility
        * To data being truly open – conflicting regulations, privacy/protection, copyright/licensing (no agreed-upon ‘open’ license; unclear who ‘owns’ a dataset for IP purposes), competition issues (is data being opened in a way that disadvantages certain entities? Is tax-supported public data subsidizing private gain when used commercially as open data?), liability (i.e. responsibility for incorrect/outdated data, or data used in a harmful way)  

* Stakeholder Impact
    * Note that literature includes both impact and potential impact of OGD
    * Discuss ‘access to information’ as most direct impact of OGD, with other impacts – transparency, accountability, democracy – potentially growing from that direct impact - i.e. OGD can be a basis for transparency or accountability, but does not guarantee those outcomes
    * Literature reflects general lack of participation in OGD and absence of clear engagement strategies, although beginning to see shift toward government encouragment of usage/participation

Notes:
* Review attempts to accomplish a lot – OGD lifecycle model, review of OGD initiatives & evaluations thereof, review and classification of approaches to publishing OGD, review of publishing guidelines, review of challenges related to both publication & consumption of data, & assessment of overall impact of OGD on stakeholders – some individual topics appear light on details from relevant literature and attempts at synthesis can end up feeling too broad to be useful

* Abstract - "This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the literature on the types, effects, conditions and user of Open Government Data (OGD). The review analyses 101 academic studies about OGD which discuss at least one of the four factors of OGD utilization: the different types of utilization, the effects of utilization, the key conditions, and the different users. Our analysis shows that the majority of studies focus on the OGD provisions while assuming, but not empirically testing, various forms of utilization. The paper synthesizes the hypothesized relations in a multi-dimensional framework of OGD utilization. Based on the framework we suggest four future directions for research: 1) investigate the link between type of utilization and type of users (e.g. journalists, citizens) 2) investigate the link between type of user and type of effect (e.g. societal, economic and good governance benefits) 3) investigate the conditions that moderate OGD effects (e.g. policy, data quality) and 4) establishing a causal link between utilization and OGD outcomes."

Summary

* Focus - ways in which open government data is utilized - "As a result of this surge in academic attention on OGD usage, a systematic and comprehensive overview of what we know about OGD utilization is lacking....The contribution of this systematic literature review is twofold. First, it provides an overview of the current OGD research focusing on the utilisation of OGD. Second, our objective is to synthesize the current body of knowledge by developing a multi-dimensional framework of OGD utilization and use this framework as basis to present suggestions for future research.”

* Based on ‘Technology Acceptance Model’ - “We will discuss the literature in four broad categories: the types of OGD utilization, the subsequent effects, the contextual conditions moderating these effects, and the user groups of OGD . These four categories were chosen because it aligns with an often made distinction in technology acceptance models, which have been widely used and tested.”
    * “Types of utilization refer to the use and re-use of OGD for a particular purpose, typically as a field of study or practice.“
    * “Effects refer to the potential results and outcomes of OGD utilization from social, economic or good governance perspectives.”
    * “Conditions refer to the environmental features or aspects of overall OGD utilization functioning as technical, social or political paradigms of public data usability.” 
    * “Users, which describe individuals or groups that use public data for achieving the targeted effects and gaining value mostly in the form of product, advantage or practice.”

* Methodology: 
    * Systematic literature review – 1) collection; 2) analysis; 3) synthesis
    * Databases searched: Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, ACM database
    * Keywords – “open government data” & “open data” in title, abstract & keywords
    * Selection Criteria – peer-reviewed, English language, government data (vs. science, NGO, etc.), address one or more ‘dimensions’ of utilization (vs. open data generally)

* Descriptive Analysis:
    * Majority of studies in developed countries, particularly US & Netherlands
    * Rapid growth in publications over past 5 years; studies primarily in e-government & IS, although relatively dispersed over different disciplines; many in conference papers rather than journals; vast majority qualitative rather than quantitative

* Thematic Analysis - authors attempt to discern key research topics within each of four areas around which they structured the review:
    * ‘Types of utilization’ – ‘innovation’ (explicitly considered a type of use rather than an effect/outcome here), ‘data analytics’, ‘decision-making’, ‘anti-corruption’, ‘smart city’, ‘research’, ‘new services’, ‘hackathons’
    * ‘Effects’ – ‘transparency/accountability’, ‘economic development’, ‘citizen participation’, ‘public services development’, ‘social value’, ‘trust of citizens’ 
        * distinguish between ‘estimated’ vs. ‘established’ effects; note that only a small portion of studies establish or measure effects rather than merely estimating or discussing them as a possibility
    * ‘Conditions’ – ‘quality of data’, ‘legislation/policy’, ‘skills’, ‘infrastructure’, ‘availability’, ‘privacy’
        * ‘quality’ – “The literature generally identifies timeliness [4], availability of metadata [71], accuracy [72] and usefulness [2] as key components of data quality.”
    * ‘Users’ – ‘citizens’, ‘business’, ‘researchers’, ‘developers’, ‘NGOs’, ‘journalists’
        * relatively understudied – little confirmation of who users are in literature, and often discuss ‘citizens’ as a block that encompasses users of all types

* Synthesis/Discussion:
    * “Most importantly we find that most relations between utilization factors are assumed or hypothesized and not tested empirically.”
    * Propose a “utilization framework” for OGD – break down each of the four factors into major subcategories and suggest relationships between them, including indications of more vs. less researched areas
        * Types – analytic (understanding/explaining) vs. synthetic (creation/development)
        * Conditions – technical (quality, availability, infrastructure) vs. social (legislation, policy, users)
        * Effects – social vs. economic vs. good governance
        * Users – direct vs. indirect

* Challenges & Opportunities for Future Research:
    * Minimal attempts made to measure/test effects and relationships with regard to OGD
    * Need investigation of how user types relate to type of use – i.e. who are ‘citizens’ and how do they use/want to use OGD?  What is the motivation of different users for using OGD?
    * Opportunity to move beyond seeing transparency/accountability as only governance benefit of OGD – cost reductions/government money-saving, public satisfaction, urban planning, etc.
    * How do 'conditions' as discussed herein, such as skills, legislation/policy, data quality, etc., affect outcomes/benefits of open data usage?  What effects do they have and in what situations?
    * Need for more rigorous experimental designs able to draw causal inferences about effects/outcomes of open data usage due to potentially confounding variables (i.e. more OGD -> more wealth, but OGD also likely to be more available and better utilized in wealthy areas)

Notes:
* Focus on utilization of OGD - who is using open data, why, and to what effect? – authors position review as a response to concern that OGD is underutilized
* Authors contrast their review to the Attard et al. review, which they characterize as focused on the ‘supply-side’/provision/publication of open data, and the Hossain et al. review, which has a much broader focus
* Although review is aimed primarily at usage of OGD, discussion of how ‘conditions’ impact usage also gets at the OGD publication process, portals, etc., and many publications included in the review do not have utilization as an exclusive focus but address utilization when investigating some other aspect of OGD

* Abstract - &quot;Open Government Data (OGD) is a government policy that is being increasingly adopted by several countries around the world. Despite its growing acceptance, there are still several difficulties both in making OGD available and ensuring it is used effectively by society. A growing body of knowledge has been produced in the last few years in the e-government scientific community to address these problems. This paper conducts a systematic literature re-view on the question of OGD, which is aimed at outlining a knowledge base of the existing scientific literature on OGD produced in the period 2007-2012 that is available in the on-line databases of relevant scientific societies (ACM, AIS, IEEE). In doing so, the paper provides an overview of this knowledge base, and maps out the different research approaches that are being adopted to study OGD, its geographical scope and the application domain they refer to. The results indicate the need of broadening the geographic coverage of OGD studies and also of deepening the discussion of quality criteria for assessing open data.&quot;

Summary
* Focus - review of 2007-2012 open data literature that aims "to conduct a survey and identify the main primary studies carried out on Open Government Data by classifying the studies according to the research methodology employed, the geographical scope involved, the domain of knowledge used and the way that the data were published"; minimal discussion; does not provide complete list of articles reviewed

* OGD definition – “any data produced by public sectors for anyone to use for any purpose”

* Methodology
    * Systematic review with broad research question – “what is the available literature that is concerned with making OGD available?” (from 2007-2012)
    * Sources Searched – AIS, IEEE, ACM electronic libraries
    * Keywords – “Open data” and “Open government data”, ‘related to’ “e-government”, “government”, etc. (?- unclear what ‘related to’ means in search context)
    * Indicate that some search results were excluded from study based on “requirements of conditions set out for the research” but do not make these criteria explicit

* Analysis
    * Classify reviewed studies by methodology (primarily ‘case study’ or ‘design science’), whether discusses some or all of 8 OGD principles, by geography (primarily US), by knowledge domain (such as public health, crime, transport, etc., with many studies not exhibiting any particular domain), whether any ‘artifacts’ (i.e. data) from the study were made available
    * Identify two main gaps in OGD research: 1) geographical scope, with most studies addressing US, UK, and EU; and 2) OGD quality, with authors suggesting need to rely on LOD and 8 OGD principles as key quality reference points

Overall Notes:
* Minimal discussion
* Does not appear to provide complete list of articles reviewed

* Abstract - &quot;With the proliferation of mobile network, mobile devices, and Web of things, many industries, including government departments, private firms, and research communities, offer more transparency through releasing data. The resultant effort offers a new paradigm—_open data_—still at infancy stage. Despite the rising research initiatives explaining its benefits and challenges and demonstrating policy conception and project details, no systematic survey of extant literature on open data has been performed. Hence, there is need for studies that examine open data on a holistic canvas, assess the current status of research, and propose future directions. Here, we conduct a review of extant literature to ascertain the current state of research on open data, and present an extensive exploration for 11 types of analyses: contexts, perspectives, level of analysis, research methods, the drivers, benefits, barriers, theory/model development, the most productive journals, authors, and institutions. Additionally, we present several future research agendas. This study also explains the implications to assist researchers, policymakers, and journal editors.&quot;

Summary
* Focus - "to explore and synthesize extant literature on open data by focusing on three high level agendas": 1) "intellectual substance" of articles, 2) "factors" related to open data, such as "drivers, benefits, impediments, and theoretical developments", and 3) identification of "leading journals, more prolific authors, and institutions"
    * “Open data is a “philosophy” or “strategy” that encourages mostly public organizations to release objective, factual, and nonperson-specific data that are generated or collected through the delivery of public services, to anyone, with a possibility of further operation and integration, without any copyright restrictions.”
    * Other review articles discussed:
        * “Nonetheless, some initial attempts (Zuiderwijk et al. 2014a, 2014b) have already been made to review research on this topic. Zuiderwijk and colleagues (2014a) aimed at contributing to research on open data transparency and policies. The authors discussed definitions, developments, research, challenges, and barriers linked to open data transparency and policies. Their study concluded the assumptions related to research and policy reports, which indicate that open data can be used as a tool to improve transparency. The research also showed that although open data policies are increasingly being developed, they are barely able to guide the publication and use of open data (Zuiderwijk et al. 2014a). A study by Zuiderwijk and coauthors (2014b) analyzed existing publications to explore the relationship between innovation and open data. The analysis of the open data publications also indicated that most of the papers in this area are primarily conceptual in nature with the descriptions of the empirical uses of open data or design of technology and systems. The authors also found that limited attention has been given for theory development (Zuiderwijk et al. 2014b).”
    * Authors focus on “three high-level agendas”:
        * 1) “intellectual progress/substance” of approaches to open data research – research processes/methods, contexts, perspectives
        * 2) “understand[ing] of open data” developed through research to date – drivers, benefits, barriers, theoretical models
        * 3) “identifying the leading journals, more prolific authors, and institutions”

* Methodology 
    * Timeline – 1996-2014
    * “First, a comprehensive search using a combination of a descriptor, “open data” was realized within the following databases: SCOPUS, Emerald, ProQuest, EBSCOhost (Business Source Complete), and Science Direct. This search produced overwhelming number of records. We considered only the papers that have both keywords (i.e., Open and Data) in the title, in any order....The second stage was more complex. We mainly focused on journal papers along with conference proceedings and book-chapters. Afterward, we performed a screening process by skimming the papers, in order to assess its fit with our research objectives. For instance, many papers used both terms but did not mean open data research (e.g., open library data, linguistic linked open data). Moreover, many papers presented studies from the domain beyond IS (e.g., chemistry, biology)—these papers were excluded. Then, the papers that demonstrated hard-core technical issues (e.g., developing algorithms) were excluded. In this process, the editorials, opinions, and perspectives too were excluded from analysis. That resulted as a set of 96 relevant papers for analyses.”
    * Review Process - "The review was conducted by coding relevant elements (such as topics and methods of published articles in the discipline), which were then grouped into more general/high-level concepts...”

* Authors categorize studies with aim of answering 3 research questions

* RQ1 – “What constitutes the intellectual substances?” - categorize studies under following headings:
    * “Context” – “setting or environment where a study takes place"
        * [Difficult to determine precisely how term is being used – i.e. is this who is releasing the data? where it is being used? – seems to encompass both public vs. private and geographic location in this review]
        * Articles with a broader focus seem to have been characterized as “mixed context” or “general”
    * “Perspectives”
        * Classified studies as using one or more of the following “perspectives”: Technical, Social, Institutional/organizational, Legal/ethical, Economic, Operational, Political/Policy/Strategic, General (adopted from Zuiderwijk, A., and M. Janssen. 2014b)
        * [Given that many studies utilize 3+ perspectives, feels somewhat arbitrary/non-useful to attempt this categorization?  Indicates that “perspectives” are adopted from a Zuiderwijk et al. study, but citation doesn’t seem correct?]
    * “Level of Analysis” – “level at which the research is conducted” - “individual”, “group”, “organizational”, “interorganizational” as levels, as well as ‘abstract” and ‘mixed’
    * “Research Methods” - Empirical vs. non-empirical; quantitative vs. qualitative vs. conceptual/theoretical; case study vs. workshop vs. conceptual…

* RQ2 – “What progress is made in research to understand open data?” - categorize studies under following headings:
    * “Drivers of open data movement” – including “Political leadership”, “Institutional pressure”, “Technological development”
    * “Benefits/opportunities/outcomes of open data” – look at private, government, and research data
    * “Impediments/challenges/risks”
        * Discuss a series of review articles examining & categorizing barriers/impediments to open data  (p. 29)
        * Group and discuss 4 categories of impediments – “individual”, “institutional”, “legal”, “technological”
    * “Theoretical models used/identified” - Identify “12 theories”

* RQ3 – “Who are the contributing members?”
    * Rank most prolific journals, authors, & institutions
    * Research gaps/directions/implications
        * “open data behavioral models” – more investigation into adoption & diffusion processes
        * Economics of open data – how can investments in open data be evaluated? How can contribution of open data to economy be assessed? Who should pay for open data, how should costs be shared?
        * Politics of open data – how are mandates/directives interpreted; how can they be used as a way to manipulate or fragment data in a misleading way?
        * Legal/ethical issues – privacy implications; need for broader legal framework around open data

* Acknowledged limitations – “exclusion of technical studies and papers from other domains than IS such as biology”, “five major databases”, selection of articles based on title only, limited primarily to journal articles


Notes:
* Language of this review is frequently unclear – many sentences are ambiguous and/or difficult to understand, to a degree that makes it frequently difficult to grasp the underlying points being made
* Search/review process is only vaguely explained – criteria are not made explicit, i.e. “fit with our research objectives”, exclusion of “hard-core technical perspectives”, exclusion of “domain beyond IS”, etc.
* Not restricted to government data – includes discussion of studies on academic/research data, linked open data in libraries/museums, etc.

* Abstract - &quot;The opening of government data, in order to have both social and economic value generated from them, has attracted the attention and interest of both researchers and practitioners from various disciplines, such as information systems, management sciences, political and social sciences, and law. Despite the rapid growth of this multidisciplinary research domain, which has led to the emergence and continuous evolution of technologies and management approaches for open government data (OGD), a detailed analysis of the specific areas and topics of this research is still missing. In this article, a detailed taxonomy of research areas and corresponding research topics of the OGD domain is presented: it includes four main research areas (ODG management and policies, infrastructures, interoperability and usage and value), which are further analyzed into 35 research topics. An important advantage of this taxonomy, beyond its high level of detail, is that it has been developed through extraction and a combination of relevant knowledge from three different sources: important relevant government policy documents, research literature, and experts. For each of the 35 research topics we have identified, its research literature is summarized and main research objectives and directions are highlighted. Based on the taxonomy, an extension of the extant OGD lifecycle is advanced; also, under-researched topics that require further research are identified.&quot;

Summary:
* Focus - by reviewing "government policy documents", "research literature", and a workshop of "experts", create "a detailed taxonomy of research areas and corresponding research topics of the OGD domain"  
    * Attempt to establish a “common code” regarding main OGD research topics, particularly to facilitate communication & interaction between researches & practitioners; aim of developing a ‘naming and classification theory’ for OGD

* Methodology:
    * ‘Bottom-up’ approach to taxonomy development via content analysis
    * Began by identifying OGD policy documents (i.e. EU, US, UK directives on OGD), then identified previous papers that had proposed classifications, and from there defined ‘main research topics’; then conducted literature search in Egovernment reference library (EGRL), and added additional topics, then organized workshop of OGD ‘experts’ from EU countries, and used this input to further refine classification scheme

* Literature Review - Discuss 4 previous studies that propose classifications of OGD research areas:
    * Davies et al. (2013) – 1) open data readiness assessments, 2) open data implementation studies, and 3) impact studies
    * Zuiderwijk et al. (2014a) – seven ‘perspectives’ on OGD research – 1) political, 2) social, 3) economical, 4) institutional, 5) operational, 6) legal, 7) technical; and identifies 3 research directions 1) OD theory & development, 2) OD policies, use, & innovation, and 3) OD infrastructures & technologies
    * Lindman et al. (2014) – ‘work systems’ framework; 2 basic approaches: 1) lifecycle of the data, and 2) levels of inquiry at which OD is studied; leading to 7 proposed catgories of research: 1) Technologies, 2) Information, 3) Process & Activities, 4) Products & Services, 5) Participants, 6) Customers, and 7) Environment
    * Harrison et al. (2012) – OGD as a dimension of the open government ecosystem

* Taxonomy 
    * Includes 4 major areas at top level with 35 research topics at second level 
        * 1) Management & Policies – includes policy & legal; anonymization methods, cleaning methods, quality assessment, visualization methods, linking, publishing, mining, rating/feedback
        * 2) Infrastructures – portals architecture, web services/APIs, user profiling, long-term preservation, storage, cloud computing, citizen-generated data, sensor-generated data
        * 3) Interoperability – metadata, multilinguality issues, services interoperability standards, semantic annotation, ontologies, platform/technical interoperability, organizational interoperability, controlled vocabularies
        * 4) Usage & Value – skills management, reputation management, OGD use, OGD-based entrepreneurship, value & impact assessment, needs analysis, accountability, readiness assessment, portals evaluation framework, innovation

* Discussion
    * Note that research topics are not necessarily based on existence of literature – some research topics have little or no existing research – particularly if these were proposed by workshop participants
    * Figure 8 – indicates number of publications per research topic, with ‘Use’ as having greatest number of publications [authors indicate that only “few” publications crossed categories/encompassed multiple categories - ??]
    * Propose an “extended OGD life cycle” – Table 5 – Create, Pre-Process, Curate, Store/Obtain, Publish, Retrieve/Acquire, Process, Use, Collaborate
    * Indicates that this taxonomy “is associated with and extends/elaborates the ICT-enabled Governance research taxnomy developed in the CROSSROAD and CROSSOVER European projects” related to ICT-enabled governance, and suggest possible future research topics related topics in both taxonomies

* Conclusion
    * Taxonomy process revealed “thematic richness” of OGD research – wide range of topics, both technical and non-technical
    * Note that only limited ‘validation’ of the taxonomy by 'experts' via a single workshop, and existing literature was culled only from the E-government Research Library

Notes:
* Methodology described only at a high level, making it difficult to get a sense of why certain divisions and topics selected
* Second-level ‘research topics’ seem to vary significantly in breadth – some are very broad, others very narrow and specific; some seem to encompass other topics at the same level – i.e. ‘OGD use’  seems like it could include, for instance, ‘OGD-based entrepreneurship’ and/or ‘OGD innovation’
* Minimal explanation for topic groupings, which often feel somewhat arbitrary – for instance, grouping OGD legal issues together with data cleaning methods in the 'Management & Policies' category
* Difficult to understand how this taxonomy is useful in directing future research - seems to be only a cursory attempt to discuss areas where research is lacking?
