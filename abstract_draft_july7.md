### Abstract

Open data has garnered the attention of researchers from many disciplines, including computer science, law, public policy, management, and political and other social sciences, over the past decade. However, the applicability of information science approaches to the entire open data lifecycle, from the creation and publication of data by producers, to the discovery, access, and interpretation of data by consumers, as well as the broader social and technological impacts of open data initiatives, make open data of unique interest to information scientists. This article reviews research about open data through an information science lens, mapping extant research to the information science field, providing insight into how existing avenues of open data research correspond to the subfields of information science. By highlighting areas in which information science approaches have been underapplied to open data, it also suggests future directions and potential challenges for open data research.
