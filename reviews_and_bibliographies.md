* 123 tagged publications with abstracts
* &quot;What insights can be gathered from the research literature on open data? This project aims to find out by reviewing and cataloguing the landscape of publications.

* &quot;We&#39;ve been maintaining a shared bibliography for the Open Data Research Network since 2013, featuring new publications in our monthly newsletter. In order to dig deeper into the contents of these articles, we set up a structured taxonomy to tag them for geographical, thematic and sectoral focus, and to explore which articles included evidence of impacts from open data.&quot;

* Abstract - "We conduct a systematic survey with the aim of assessing open government data initiatives, that is; any attempt, by a government or otherwise, to open data that is produced by a governmental entity. We describe the open government data life-cycle and we focus our discussion on publishing and consuming processes required within open government data initiatives. We cover current approaches undertaken for such initiatives, and classify them. A number of evaluations found within related literature are discussed, and from them we extract challenges and issues that hinder open government initiatives from reaching their full potential. In a bid to overcome these challenges, we also extract guidelines for publishing data and provide an integrated overview. This will enable stakeholders to start with a firm foot in a new open government data initiative. We also identify the impacts on the stakeholders involved in such initiatives."

* Abstract - "This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the literature on the types, effects, conditions and user of Open Government Data (OGD). The review analyses 101 academic studies about OGD which discuss at least one of the four factors of OGD utilization: the different types of utilization, the effects of utilization, the key conditions, and the different users. Our analysis shows that the majority of studies focus on the OGD provisions while assuming, but not empirically testing, various forms of utilization. The paper synthesizes the hypothesized relations in a multi-dimensional framework of OGD utilization. Based on the framework we suggest four future directions for research: 1) investigate the link between type of utilization and type of users (e.g. journalists, citizens) 2) investigate the link between type of user and type of effect (e.g. societal, economic and good governance benefits) 3) investigate the conditions that moderate OGD effects (e.g. policy, data quality) and 4) establishing a causal link between utilization and OGD outcomes."

* Annotated bibliography with abstracts and short narrative literature review

* &quot;The Open Government Data Literature Review project produced an analysis of key literature about open government data and the recordkeeper&#39;s role in order to establish a framework for further research.&quot;

* &quot;The particular interest of this literature review is the intersection between open government data and records and archives management. The review has found that this is a vastly underresearched area that warrants much more attention than it is currently receiving either from the open data or the records and archives management communities.&quot;

* &quot;The present literature review found that the number of resources available for the study of open government data is growing rapidly, but this rapid growth is not necessarily reflected in the traditional means of scholarly communication, such as peer-reviewed journals. Instead, much of the discourse about open government data is spread across various media, platforms and formats, and takes place between various actors including governments, academics, nongovernment organisations and activists, both as individuals and participants in networks of varying degrees of formality and coherence.&quot;

* Abstract - &quot;Open Government Data (OGD) is a government policy that is being increasingly adopted by several countries around the world. Despite its growing acceptance, there are still several difficulties both in making OGD available and ensuring it is used effectively by society. A growing body of knowledge has been produced in the last few years in the e-government scientific community to address these problems. This paper conducts a systematic literature re-view on the question of OGD, which is aimed at outlining a knowledge base of the existing scientific literature on OGD produced in the period 2007-2012 that is available in the on-line databases of relevant scientific societies (ACM, AIS, IEEE). In doing so, the paper provides an overview of this knowledge base, and maps out the different research approaches that are being adopted to study OGD, its geographical scope and the application domain they refer to. The results indicate the need of broadening the geographic coverage of OGD studies and also of deepening the discussion of quality criteria for assessing open data.&quot;

* Abstract - &quot;With the proliferation of mobile network, mobile devices, and Web of things, many industries, including government departments, private firms, and research communities, offer more transparency through releasing data. The resultant effort offers a new paradigm—_open data_—still at infancy stage. Despite the rising research initiatives explaining its benefits and challenges and demonstrating policy conception and project details, no systematic survey of extant literature on open data has been performed. Hence, there is need for studies that examine open data on a holistic canvas, assess the current status of research, and propose future directions. Here, we conduct a review of extant literature to ascertain the current state of research on open data, and present an extensive exploration for 11 types of analyses: contexts, perspectives, level of analysis, research methods, the drivers, benefits, barriers, theory/model development, the most productive journals, authors, and institutions. Additionally, we present several future research agendas. This study also explains the implications to assist researchers, policymakers, and journal editors.&quot;

* Abstract - &quot;The opening of government data, in order to have both social and economic value generated from them, has attracted the attention and interest of both researchers and practitioners from various disciplines, such as information systems, management sciences, political and social sciences, and law. Despite the rapid growth of this multidisciplinary research domain, which has led to the emergence and continuous evolution of technologies and management approaches for open government data (OGD), a detailed analysis of the specific areas and topics of this research is still missing. In this article, a detailed taxonomy of research areas and corresponding research topics of the OGD domain is presented: it includes four main research areas (ODG management and policies, infrastructures, interoperability and usage and value), which are further analyzed into 35 research topics. An important advantage of this taxonomy, beyond its high level of detail, is that it has been developed through extraction and a combination of relevant knowledge from three different sources: important relevant government policy documents, research literature, and experts. For each of the 35 research topics we have identified, its research literature is summarized and main research objectives and directions are highlighted. Based on the taxonomy, an extension of the extant OGD lifecycle is advanced; also, under-researched topics that require further research are identified.&quot;
