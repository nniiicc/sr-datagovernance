* Abstract - &quot;Wikipedia may be the best-developed attempt thus far to gather all human knowledge in one place. Its accomplishments in this regard have made it a point of inquiry for researchers from different fields of knowledge. A decade of research has thrown light on many aspects of the Wikipedia community, its processes, and its content. However, due to the variety of fields inquiring about Wikipedia and the limited synthesis of the extensive research, there is little consensus on many aspects of Wikipedia&#39;s content as an encyclopedic collection of human knowledge. This study addresses the issue by systematically reviewing 110 peer-reviewed publications on Wikipedia content, summarizing the current findings, and highlighting the major research trends. Two major streams of research are identified: the quality of Wikipedia content (including comprehensiveness, currency, readability, and reliability) and the size of Wikipedia. Moreover, we present the key research trends in terms of the domains of inquiry, research design, data source, and data gathering methods. This review synthesizes scholarly understanding of Wikipedia content and paves the way for future studies.&quot;

* &quot;The contribution of this study is twofold. First, it systematically reviews the extant research about the various aspects of Wikipedia content, identifies the main streams of research, and summarizes and represents the current state of knowledge along these streams. This provides the research community with insights regarding the varied domain of inquiries on Wikipedia content, which can be used as a knowledge map for further inquiries; it also highlights the underinvestigated areas of research that would be helpful in formulating new lines of study. Second, it analyzes the trends in all aspects of Wikipedia content, ranging from chronological trends to various trends in theory type, research design, and data-gathering methods employed by the research community. This may inform the design of studies to better capture unique aspects of Wikipedia content, and even point to underused methods that may encourage new designs and approaches to studying the Wikipedia phenomenon.&quot;

* Abstract - &quot;Recent policy shifts on the part of funding agencies and journal publishers are causing changes in the acknowledgment and citation behaviors of scholars. A growing emphasis on open science and reproducibility is changing how authors cite and acknowledge &quot;research infrastructures&quot;—entities that are used as inputs to or as underlying foundations for scholarly research, including data sets, software packages, computational models, observational platforms, and computing facilities. At the same time, stakeholder interest in quantitative understanding of impact is spurring increased collection and analysis of metrics related to use of research infrastructures. This article reviews work spanning several decades on tracing and assessing the outcomes and impacts from these kinds of research infrastructures. We discuss how research infrastructures are identified and referenced by scholars in the research literature and how those references are being collected and analyzed for the purposes of evaluating impact. Synthesizing common features of a wide range of studies, we identify notable challenges that impede the analysis of impact metrics for research infrastructures and outline key open research questions that can guide future research and applications related to such metrics.&quot;

* &quot;This review discusses how research infrastructures are identified and referenced in the research literature and how those references are being collected and analyzed for the purposes of impact evaluation. We begin with some background on bibliometric studies more broadly, which provides the framework for this discussion in terms of the behavioral and methodological issues. We then review the literature covering three categories of infrastructure: data sets, software, and platforms and facilities. ...We next examine a number of studies that leveraged &quot;proxy metrics,&quot; such as downloads and usage data, to bypass some of the methodological issues faced by studies based on scholarly outputs. Finally, we conclude by synthesizing the commonalities that span these studies—including analytical goals, metrics gathered, and methodologies—and the common challenges, barriers to progress, and open research questions for those interested in better understanding the scholarly impacts of research infrastructures.&quot;

* Abstract -  &quot;This article presents a review of literature from diverse fields, including information science, technology studies, surveillance studies, and participatory research traditions to explore how participatory personal data relate to existing personal data collections created by both research and surveillance. It applies three information perspectives—information policy, information access and equity, and data curation and preservation—to illustrate social impacts and concerns engendered by this new form of data collection. These perspectives suggest a set of research challenges for information science posed by participatory personal data.&quot;

* &quot;This article draws on literature from information science, technology studies, and surveillance studies to investigate granular personal data, collected by and for individuals, as an information problem. It uses this literature to explore two questions: How do these new forms of personal data depart from existing personal data? And how do information perspectives help us analyze the social values, impacts, and concerns engendered by these new data? These questions suggest new research challenges for privacy and information policy, information access and equity, and data management, curation, and preservation.&quot;

* &quot;The article begins by defining _participatory personal data_, and suggesting how these data differ from existing research and surveillance data. It then explores literature from three information perspectives key to understanding participatory personal data: information policy, information access, and data management and preservation. It uses these perspectives to suggest next steps to investigate participatory personal data as an information science problem.&quot;

* &quot;In sum, the present review summarizes the prior work that contributes to a better understanding of information seeking in a visual context and presents future directions for research. The specific objectives include:

    * Review the research that can be applied for conceptually and practically understanding users and uses of digital visual information.
    * Demonstrate variations and similarities with other information seeking and interaction models through discussion and show how findings apply specifically to visual information.
    * Suggest where further research is needed.

* "The present review of visual information seeking is guided and organized according to a set of generalized stages or phases from information seeking models, including _needs_, _actions_, and _assessments_. These topics comprise the structure of discussion and synthesis of the methods and findings throughout this report.&quot;


Mathiesen, K. (2015), Human rights as a topic and guide for LIS research and practice. J Assn Inf Sci Tec, 66: 1305–1322. doi:10.1002/asi.23293

* Abstract - &quot;This paper surveys the literature at the intersection of LIS and human rights. To begin, an overview of human rights conventions and an introduction to human rights theory is provided. Then the intersections between LIS and human rights are considered. Three central areas of informational human rights—communication, privacy, and intellectual property—are discussed in detail. It is argued that communication rights in particular serve as a central linchpin in the system of human rights.&quot;

* &quot;The last half of the paper focuses on human rights specifically in relation to LIS. Two areas of intersection between human rights and LIS are identified—&quot;human rights informatics&quot; and &quot;informational human rights&quot; (a subtopic within information ethics). The final section of the paper discusses human rights related to three core information rights: the right to communication, to information privacy, and to intellectual property. The ethical foundation of each of these rights is discussed and the impact of new information and communication technologies (ICTs) on these rights is briefly considered.&quot;

* Abstract - &quot;We present a systematic review of research on academic scientists&#39; involvement in these activities to which we refer as &#39;academic engagement&#39;. Apart from extracting findings that are generalisable across studies, we ask how academic engagement differs from commercialisation, defined as intellectual property creation and academic entrepreneurship. We identify the individual, organisational and institutional antecedents and consequences of academic engagement, and then compare these findings with the antecedents and consequences of commercialisation.&quot;

* &quot;The research question guiding our review is: What are the antecedents and consequences of academic engagement? We will consolidate results from all existing studies and extract generally applicable results. In a further step, we compare our findings with what is known about the antecedents and consequences of commercialisation, i.e. intellectual property creation and academic entrepreneurship.&quot;

* &quot;Our work adds to existing research in four important ways. We provide the first systematic review of academic engagement and compare the latter with commercialisation….Second, we synthesise our empirical results into a novel theoretical framework on academic engagement….Third, we make a methodological contribution, by discussing why studying academic engagement requires methodological approaches that differ from those for studying commercialisation. ...Fourth, our results are policy-relevant.&quot;
